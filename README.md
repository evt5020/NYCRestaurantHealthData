# NYCRestaurantHealthData

I'm interested in using this data to see if there are any trends around cuisine influence or borough location on health score.

I'm using the NYC Health grade dataset to answer the question.

The data is very unclean, and requires a lot of one hot encoding.

I picked this topic because I'm interested in the food and restaurant industry. If I had more time, I would try bucketing the scores, and perhaps using a classification model vs. trying to predict a continous value of a score.
